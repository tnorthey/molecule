define chi^2


say that I allow more freedom of movement to mode 0 "imagine I heated it" in the 1m and 2m simulations
- basically Wigner with a "hot" methyl motion

- still resolution problem, dare I say that improved experiment resolution would solve it?


introduce normal mode method
- it can be automated; 
- choose top N modes that have lowest <chi^2>

- goal is much lower confomational dimensions to search
  increases density of structure pool in important region
- computationally faster!
