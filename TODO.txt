move along modes with various fixed step-sizes

use algorithm and plot chi2 with different max_step-size



keep saving to a file 'restart.npz' all the best ds value for each step, then re-running always improves
- it loads that value but still adds variance 
- "UseRestart" option 


use knowledge of magnitude oftarget-pcd to have ds(t), and N(t)
"nearby" assumption, low ds, which increases slightly on restart (or revert)


T dependent step-size works much better at low time

- assume some time-steps are further away and the generally lower step-sizes can't reach them

- therefore, needs to increase step-size proportional to t (time)
--- or decide the step-size somehow at the beginning of each t-step
--- or increase temperature proportional to t (as that also increases step-size anyway)
