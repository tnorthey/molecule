T dependent step-size works much better at low time

- assume some time-steps are further away and the generally lower step-sizes can't reach them

- therefore, needs to increase step-size proportional to t (time)
--- or decide the step-size somehow at the beginning of each t-step
--- or increase temperature proportional to t (as that also increases step-size anyway)
