SA involves the step of choosing the next sample
i.e. perturbing the molecule somehow


Cartesians:

I can move each atom randomly, but that's by a direction and a magnitude
- normal modes is only by a magnitude


Distances / Inverse distances:

If I use distances (or inverse distances), I need to map back to xyz coordinates.
There isn't a 1:1 mapping from distances to xyz

I can displace the distances, and then add that displacement to xyz
How are the displacements defined by changing a distance?


Gradient:

I want to change the target function the most. That is move along the gradient...
Seems to not care what coordinates I use... as long as I move along the gradient. ?

Ok, try that.


The coefficients (assume they are r_ij) change by -alpha * gradient_of_chi2
- I know the gradient, so it's possible
- Do for diatomic
- do for triatomic, etc.
