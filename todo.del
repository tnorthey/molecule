my own C-N-O angle code: apply to geommovie, argmin_traj etc.

0.5, 1, 2m convergence
best chi2 definition

0.5, 1, 2m all modes

example: iterate along mode 0
example: iterate along mode 1
example: iterate along mode 48 (a few H-only modes)
etc.

test: only mode 0, N=1000 

(maybe) rerun with larger amplitute along mode 0
